## Motivation
This package was originally created specifically to allow testing of Express AngularJS apps tested with Jasmine, Karma, and Protractor. However, it is written in a general enough way that it could be used in another node based testing environment.


## How to use with Protractor
See the [Protractor guide](/docs/protractor.md)
